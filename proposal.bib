  booktitle={Security and Privacy, 2003. Proceedings. 2003 Symposium on},
  pages={197--213},
  year={2003},
  abstract={In this paper suggests three mechanisms for the exchange of random key pre-distribution, which leads to the protection of a sensor network from several attacks, these mechanisms are:q-composite keys scheme, multipath-reinforcement scheme and random-pairwise keys scheme.Also researcher use many metric to evaluate their scheme (resilience against node capture, resistance against node replication, revocation, scale.
  First mechanism is used q common keys, where $q>1$ instead of using a single key as in the basic scheme, where these keys are an overlap to increase the link security in the network, which means that adversary find it difficult to break the link, since this scheme differs from the basic scheme in overlapping keys and reduce the key bool size, key bool size should not be very large and that leads to that the network is not be connected after bootstrapping protocol is complete, nor very small because this leads to sacrifice in network security, where must choose key bool size appropriate. this mechanism is strong for the network when the small number of nodes captured.
  Second mechanism uses the same setup key in basic scheme, difference is to add random values to secure the link between two nodes, such as A and B, where A generates random values with common key along the path, the benefit is even if an eavesdropper discovered key from the other nodes, it cannot penetrate the path, also eavesdropper needs discovery full path values even eavesdropper can penetrate the path.This mechanism cannot operate with the mechanism of q-composite together because it leads to a security weakness.

Third mechanism is as follows before the deployment of nodes, each node generates ID for the total of network nodes (n), where each node has ID, pairwise key. After deployment, setup key phase begins where each node broadcasts ID to its neighbors, any node knows ID, and this node can use the authentication through pairwise and accomplish handshake operation.  Because of the small size of ID, which gives less traffic and less computations this leads to expansion of the network through the rebroadcast on the level of hop but brings with it the problem of DOS attack. this mechanism has many advantages that is	perfect resilience against node capture, node-to-node identity authentication, Distributed Node Revocation(Not to rely on BS to revoke nodes), resistance to node replication and generation and comparable scalability},

  abstract={In this paper, a new Group Key Establishment protocol proposed in wireless sensor network restricted energy, where the aim of this research is to protect the network with the energy balance. The authors noted that the best protocol maintains the energy and uses memory requirements limited and suitable for networks wireless sensor is GDH.3, the researchers had improved this Protocol where the nodes in this protocol have the tasks of unequal, which last node (Mn) implements more tasks than other nodes. This leads to consumption capacity quickly in sensors. GDH.3 protocol uses four stages, the new protocol cancelled a stage 3 and 4, where it make all nodes implement the same tasks that led to the energy balance. The proposed protocol applied in real networks and simulation. The results showed that GDH.3 better than the new protocol to work in small networks, while the new protocol better to work in large networks. The new protocol needs more time than the GDH.3 protocol because the new protocol needs many encryption and decryption operations but in return the new protocol is the best in the energy balance in the sensors network, and the results showed that the change in the spacing nodes does not affect the energy of nodes in the new protocol while large spacing between nodes affect greatly on the energy consumption in GDH.3 protocol},

The researchers discovered that the ECC to suffer from the weakness of security such as former security systems. They are focused on the three points is the deployment, weak keys, vulnerable signatures. They gathered data bases belonging to the four protocols and found that there are several cases of repeated public keys in SSH and TLS. Bitcoins suffer that there are several signatures share nonces that allow attacker to compute the corresponding private keys and steal coins. Australian citizen card as well as suffer from a multi-use the keys. The big problem with encryption is not random adequacy in generating keys or nonces in digital signatures, for example, Debian OpenSSL},

  year={2002},
  abstract={In this research, the researchers designed new key management scheme for DSN networks large scale. This scheme depends on the possibility of the sharing of the key among nodes in random graph. In this scheme, there are three stages are before the distribution, shared-key discovery and path-key establishment. The first stage summed up in several steps: Configure key pool with the identifiers of the key, create a key ring from the key pool, load key ring to each node and link node ID with a trusted controller node. Then begins the second stage of which is that each node broadcast identifiers, any other node has the same node identifier, and this node can connect to and use the shared-key. Then the third phase begins, which is that nodes that do not use the shared-key is possible to use the path-key, where this node connects through two links or more at the end of the key discovery phase. This scheme also provides two mechanisms revocation and rekeying to protect the key. In this scheme cannot be compromised all links like the previous traditional mechanisms because if the attacker compromised node, he cannot access all the links because it does not have all the keys},

Researchers used a new scheme of ECDSA to secure the connection between the gateway and the cluster head(CH), and CH and nodes. This scheme broadcasts only session keys (km), which reduces energy as the session keys deletes after their account and that lead to less memory (the number of a few keys stored in memory). The public key of the gateway does not require power, and calculation processes accomplished through the use of a random number and hash function that require less calculated.

This scheme depends on reducing the consumption of signature verification by using the concept of neighboring nodes, and thereby reduce the energy consumption of the network. It describes the original ECDSA with 2 scalar and addition point while the modified ECDSA scheme used 1 scalar and addition point with a 4 * 4 grid-based WSN. The idea in this paper is that the nodes send the results of intermediate computation to their neighbors, for example node A sends a result of intermediate calculation (signature verification N1P) , Signature and the message to node B, and B achieve one scalar and addition point to produce N2Q, where B produces N1P + N2Q and send the result to their neighbors, this will reduce energy consumption in  signature verification, as the proposed scheme faster 15.5\% and less energy  50\% of the original scheme.

Authors focused on the SCA attack used SPA and DPA analysis (DPA analysis neglected because it is not viable in the ECC algorithm). SCA attack is working on the use of information leaked from the SPM (Q = KP) and try to use this information to get the key. They also analyzed in detail the types of SPM algorithms that are D \& A, WM and CM. In addition to discussing the use of different coordinate systems such as projective coordinates and Affine coordinates, through experiments they found that coordinates projective faster by 91\% of Affine coordinates and vice versa for the memory, which the projective coordinates require more memory. During the results the authors concluded that the way CM faster than D \& A and WM because the CM uses less doubling and adding points. But this method need more memory. As for security, the D \& A method is the best with 27\% . D \& A is good at memory requirements but they need more time. Authors concluded several concepts that SPM is based on the user's application and constrained sources, execution time affects the energy consumption and protect the ephemeral K very important in ECDSA against SPA attacks.

Authors implement this attack on point multiplication through Montgomery ladder and D\&A algorithm. The successful in this attack is probability, this attack tries to get on bits from k through many signatures. Authors use projective Jacobian coordinate system through implementation because it is efficient. Also authors use countermeasure to fault attack through using discrete algorithm l in point representation (Q=(X:Y:Z;l), where modifying by adversary for point addition and point doubling is detection.

They used different coordinate systems (Affine, Projective, Jacobian and Lopez Dahab Projective) on point addition and doubling. They note Jacobian is the most efficient with Weiestrass while Projective is the most efficient with Hessian. They also used mixed coordinate (Affine-Projective) on both Weistrass and Hessian. Through using mixed coordinate, results refer to improve timing in addition formula},

Through implementation, they found the best algorithm in term timing in field multiplication that is LR Comb with w=4 compared with shift-and-add, LR Comb, RL Comb and Karatsuba algorithm. While the best algorithm in inversion is extended Euclidean algorithm EEA compared with almost inverse algorithm AIA and modified almost inverse algorithm MAIA when implementation in C on Pentium II. Also they noted the best algorithm for PM in random curves (ECC and ECDSA) is fixed-base comb with w=4, while in Koblitz curves is fixed-base window TNAF with w=6 in the case memory is not constrained. When memory constrained, Montgomery is the best with random and TNAF is the best with Koblitz. They point out Koblitz curves are faster than random binary curves.},

To find operation of 2P+Q, Authors used form ((P+Q)+P), also operation of 3P+Q, they used (((P+Q)+P)+P). This trick leaded to improve PM. For example, when number of points (1133044P), cost of original PM is 23div+41s+23m, while cost of improved PM is 23div+37s+19m, where there is improvement in m and s.
